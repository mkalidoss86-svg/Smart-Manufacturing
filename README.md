# Smart-Manufacturing

The Smart Manufacturing Quality Platform is a scalable, event-driven quality intelligence system designed to monitor manufacturing processes in near real time, detect quality anomalies, and support autonomous decision-making through Agentic AI.

## CI/CD Failure Analysis Agent

This repository includes an automated CI/CD monitoring system that:
- 🔍 Detects pipeline failures across all stages (Build, Test, Docker, Kubernetes)
- 📋 Automatically creates detailed GitHub Issues with error analysis
- 🏷️ Classifies failures and applies appropriate labels
- 💡 Provides root cause suggestions and remediation steps
- ✅ Auto-closes issues when subsequent pipeline runs succeed
- 🚫 Prevents duplicate issues for the same commit

### Quick Start

The failure analysis agent runs automatically on every push or pull request. To test it manually:

1. Go to **Actions** → **CI/CD Test - Simulated Failure**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select which stage should fail (or "none" for success)
4. Observe automatic issue creation and analysis

- [Workflow Configuration](.github/workflows/README.md)
- [CI/CD Pipeline](.github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml)

### Features

- **Intelligent Failure Detection**: Monitors Build, Test, Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes stages
- **Detailed Issue Reports**: Includes logs, links, status tables, and actionable insights
- **Smart Classification**: Automatically categorizes failures and applies relevant labels
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing issues before creating new ones
- **Auto-Assignment**: Issues are automatically assigned to repository maintainers
- **Auto-Closure**: Resolved issues close automatically when pipeline recovers
